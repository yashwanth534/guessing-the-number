# Number Guessing Game

## Description

This is a simple number guessing game where the player selects an upper bound, and the game randomly generates a number within that range. The player must guess the number, and the game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number, and it tracks how many attempts it took.

## Features

- Allows the player to input the upper bound for the guessing range.
- Generates a random number between 1 and the specified upper bound.
- Provides feedback to the player on each guess (too high or too low).
- Tracks the number of guesses made.
- Simple and interactive terminal-based gameplay.
